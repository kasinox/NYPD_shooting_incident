## mac knitting instruction

*  install brew
*  https://brew.sh/
* type the following in terminal to install homebrew
* /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


## install missing libraries

for example, sf library cannot be installed correctly in the most recent macos update, after install homebrew, type the following in the terminal

 * brew install lwgeom
 * brew install sf
 * brew install tmap

 if the console prompt any missing component that could not be installed correctly, install it in brew and knit it again
 sf package is essential for geospatial mapping in R, somehow the support in MacOs lag behind that of windows

## Knitting in windows environment have no problem so far as there is more support.
